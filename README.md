# Breast Cancer Classification using Decision Tree

This project applies a Decision Tree Classifier to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, a popular dataset available in `sklearn.datasets`.
The goal is to classify tumors as **malignant** (cancerous) or **benign** (non-cancerous) based on 30 numerical features.

## Features

- The model is trained and evaluated using standard techniques:
  - **Train-Test Split**
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)**

- It also includes a **visualization** of both:
  - the **confusion matrix** (as a heatmap).
  - the **decision tree structure** itself (using `plot_tree` from `sklearn.tree`).

## Tools

- sklearn
- matplotlib
- pandas
- python
